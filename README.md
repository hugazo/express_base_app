# Express Empty Skeleton

An "empty" skeleton for a Express app that has already setup for:

- Express (Without Views)
- Git, including a comprehensive gitignore.
- Eslint, using AirBnb preset.
- Yarn as a package manager.

## Getting Started

First, clone the project with git.

### Prerequisites

To run this app you will need as global dependencies:
- Yarn
- Nodemon
- Eslint

To install Yarn, please follow the instructions located in:

[Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Then install the global dependencies

```bash
# yarn global add nodemon eslint
```

### Running for Development

For Development with Nodemon:

```bash
# yarn run start:dev
```

For Production with Node:

```bash
# yarn run start
```

## Good Practice

It is a good practice to use git flow for development cycle and versioning.

```
# git flow init
```

And then follow the wizard to set-up Git Flow for your needs.
